Some files import `@import("raylib").raylib_module` instead of `@import("raylib")`. This a small workaround to make some files that import raylib accessible during build time and at runtime. They import the same. 

[dev_maps](assets/dev_maps) is for map data generated by [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
and [maps](assets/maps) is for map data that gets auto generated from dev_maps, so it does not need to get touched.

There are 3 different positional "systems":
1. native positions (Used by internal calculations)
2. tile coordinates (1. but divided by 16)
3. chunk coordinates (2. but divided by 32)

The function names `update` and `draw` are reserved for a structs main uopdate function and draw functions. They should not be used for something else.

Sprites of animated tiles need to be all next to each other (no line wrapping). The first tile of the animation needs to have a `frames` custom data attached.

The `y_origin_offset` property in a tile defines how much the origin used for y sorting is up or down relative to the tiles origin (normaly top edge of the tile).

Structs that need saving/loading require a `getSaveable()` function that returns an anonymous struct of references to all the variables that should get saved.

IMPORTANT:
Aways use the gpa allocator to init or deinit objects unless described otherwise.
