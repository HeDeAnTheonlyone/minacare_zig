[dev_maps](assets/dev_maps) is for map data generated by [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
and [maps](assets/maps) is for map data that gets auto generated from dev_maps, so it does not need to get touched.

There are 3 different positional "systems":
1. native positions (Used by internal calculations)
2. tile coordinates (1. but divided by 16)
3. chunk coordinates (2. but divided by 32)
