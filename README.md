Some files import `@import("raylib").raylib_module` instead of `@import("raylib")`. This a small workaround to make some files that import raylib accessible during build time and at runtime. They import the same. 

[dev_maps](assets/dev_maps) is for map data generated by [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
and [maps](assets/maps) is for map data that gets auto generated from dev_maps, so it does not need to get touched.

There are 3 different positional "systems":
1. native positions (Used by internal calculations)
2. tile coordinates (1. but divided by 16)
3. chunk coordinates (2. but divided by 32)

The function names `update` and `draw` are reserved for a structs main uopdate function and draw functions. They should not be used for something else.

Sprites of animated tiles need to be all next to each other (no line wrapping). The first tile of the animation needs to have a `frames` custom data attached.
